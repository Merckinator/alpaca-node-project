# alpaca-node-project

A small project to check stock prices daily and manage a small portfolio.

Uses Alpaca's stock trading API and is hosted in Railway.app.

## Development

Clone the repo, install dependencies with yarn, and run with the start script.

## Environment Variables

Depends on several environment variables for secrets to communicate with Alpaca; either set these up locally or login/link with the Railway CLI and use the `railway up` command to use the env variables stored there.
